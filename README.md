## Computer Science Student Graduation Checker

Disclaimer: This is a collaborative project where I primarily worked on the SQL backend. This project may continue to evolve as we refine and add new features.

The Computer Science Student Graduation Checker is a web-based tool tailored for computer science students to monitor their academic journey toward graduation. It provides a personalized degree audit, helping students keep track of completed, in-progress, and pending course requirements to ensure theyâ€™re on the path to graduation.

## Features:

**User Registration & Authentication**
- Register with personal information, including name, email, and enrollment details.
- Secure login to access individual student accounts.
- Passwords are encrypted for security.

**User Information**
- Students can enter personal information, including their name, and email.
  
**Course Management**
- **View Courses:** See a list of available courses with details like name, code, credits, and prerequisites.
- **Add Courses:** Log courses as completed, in-progress, or planned.
- **Update Course Status:** Modify course status and enter grades for accurate academic tracking.
- **Delete Courses & Semester:** If a course or a semester is not to the students liking, they can delete specific courses or even delete entire semesters.

## Progress Monitoring
- **Credit Tracking:** Calculate total completed and remaining credits.
- **Completion Percentage:** View overall degree progress based on credits completed versus required.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Degree progress automatically updates as students manage course statuses.

## Search and Filtering
